                                  Buddhist monks built monasteries in the caves nearby. 
                                  Lonavala gained popularity as a getaway and a hill station 
                                  during the British Raj. This historic city of Lonavala 
                                  was first discovered by then Governor of Bombay, Sir 
                                  Elphinstone in 1811. At the time it was a thick forest 
                                  and was sparsely populated.</div></td>

                                  However there is no historic evidence to support this. 
                                  "Layan" in Sanskrit means a place to rest. 
                                  This word when translated in "Prakrit" becomes 
                                  "Len" meaning a resting-place carved out of 
                                  stone. "Avali" means "series" in 
                                  Prakrit hence the place around which there are a series 
                                  of such Len is called "Lonavali". Lonali of 
                                  the past is today known as "Lonavala".</div></td>

                                      and belongs to Shivaji's period. There is a huge cave 
                                      outside the fort. This cave would be used for storing 
                                      grains during the rainy season. There is a tomb here 
                                      as well as a Shivlinga. Next to that there is a tank 
                                      of water with sweet taste. On the fort there is one 
                                      more place where water would be stored for use. The 
                                      peculiar design on the walls of the fort is known 
                                      as Vindhukata (fangs of a scorpion). It is said that 
                                      Shivaji Maharaj had kept the treasures he looted from 
                                      Surat in this fort for some period of time.</p>

                                      leave one spellbound. At the entrance, there is a 
                                      small temple of Ekvira Devi as well as lion pillars 
                                      and huge elephant forms are carved which represent 
                                      different forms of Gautama Buddha. The entrance gate 
                                      is in the shape of a "Peepal" leaf through 
                                      which one enters the huge Chaitya griha or hall. This 
                                      large hall is full of stone pillars, which are carved 
                                      with elephant and human forms. The roof is high and 
                                      semicircular. The pillars are surprisingly very smooth. 
                                      There are many resting rooms around here. These rooms 
                                      carved in the rocks are calm and ideal for meditation. 
                                      Water is available for drinking from the tanks around.</p>

                                      about 25 minutes by foot is small town called Bhaje. 
                                      On one side there is Lohagad fort on other side Visapur 
                                      fort and approximately in the center are Bhaja Caves. 
                                      They are similar to Karla Caves but are on a much 
                                      smaller scale. These caves are also in Chaitya style. 
                                      The specialty of these caves is that the rays of the 
                                      setting sun visit these caves. On the southern side, 
                                      there is a place where one can see carved figures 
                                      of Gods and Goddesses.</p>

                                      These caves are located on Mumbai Pune road near Kamshet, 
                                      between Kadde and Bedsa. These caves are as big as 
                                      Karla Caves but as they are located on a side off 
                                      the main road there is not much tourist traffic here. 
                                      Huge Lion pillars and a large Chaitya hall with resting 
                                      rooms is a specialty of these caves. There are smooth

                                      fall straight on the place of prayer here. This caves
