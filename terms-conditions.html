      <h5><p><u><STRONG>List of conditions when guest can be denied entry or forcibly evicted.</STRONG></u></h5></p>
      <p>One of the conditions that hotels have for a stay is "Management reserves the right refuse or grant admission". It does not happen often enough as being a part of hospitality industry hotels do not resort to the extreme.</p>
      <p>However still there are situations where this clause is applied and some of those are listed as under:</p>
      <li>Guest arrive without an Identification (Drivers License, Passport) for those destinations that require guests to identify at the time of check in. may be denied the use of the room that either was booked.</li>
      <li>Hotels rooms are meant for a stay for visitors to the destination. However hotel rooms often get used by locals for Prostitution, "time out" by unmarried couples etc. Occupying hotel rooms by unmarried couples is illegal under Indian laws and therefore hotels have a right to refuse entry or evict any guests on this ground. Most reputed 3-star and above category hotels turn a blind eye and desist asking for matrimonial status proof in case of perfectly respectful and good mannered couples. However it’s the cheaper budget hotels which police keep an Eagle's eye for any local prostitution related activity and therefore hotel managements of these hotels are sometimes extremely edgy about this and may enforce the rule even for genuine guests.</li>
      <li>No illegal activity can be carried out in a Hotel Room. If found, Hotels may report to the police or more likely evict a guest immediately.</li>
      <li>Local friends / visitors of the guests are not allowed to stay overnight in a hotel room with the guest. This may result into an immediate eviction.</li>
      <li>Guests arriving at the hotel or found anytime during the stay completely drunk or not in a stable state to carry himself / herself in a dignified way, may be denied entry or forcibly evicted.</li>
      <li>Guests that for any reason create some sort of nuisance for other guests then at the request of other guests, hotel can evict a guest immediately.</li>
      <li>Any refusal to pay any charges at the hotel after using the service can result in eviction from the hotel & hotel may report to police.</li>
      <li>Any major damage to hotel property may result into compensation or report to police.</li>
      <li>Any scuffle with any staff member over any issue may result into an eviction.</li>
      <p>Any refusal to adhere to rules and regulations of the hotels especially related to check out times can result into forced eviction from the hotel.</p>
